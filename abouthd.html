    <h2 class="verticalLineTop">OUR ROOTS</h2>
    <p>In 1903, out of a small shed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, four young men lit a cultural wildfire that would grow and 
        spread across geographies and generations. Their innovation and imagination for what was possible on two wheels sparked 
        a transportation revolution and a motorcycle culture that would make Harley-Davidson one of the most recognized and revered brands in the world.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning, we’ve proudly and authentically stood up for the things we believe in most: the rebel spirit in all of us, unity, individuality and personal freedom. These beliefs and a desire to find freedom on two wheels forge a bond that brings Harley-Davidson riders, employees, dealers, and suppliers together.
        On our quest to build the next generation of riders globally, we welcome all who share these beliefs and a desire to enjoy the world on a motorcycle.</p>
